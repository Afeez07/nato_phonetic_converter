**NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter**

This Python script converts any word you input into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet codes. It is a simple yet fun tool for learning and using the NATO phonetic alphabet, which is widely used in aviation, military, and telecommunications to avoid miscommunication.

**How It Works**

1. The program reads a CSV file (nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv) containing the NATO phonetic alphabet mappings (letters to codes).

2. It then prompts the user to input a word.

3. The word is converted into a list of NATO phonetic codes, which are displayed as output.

**Example**

If you input the word "HELLO", the output will be:

_'Hotel', 'Echo', 'Lima', 'Lima', 'Oscar'_

**Requirements**

- Python 3.x

- pandas library (pip install pandas)

**File Structure**
  
main.py: The main Python script.

nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv: The CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet mappings.
